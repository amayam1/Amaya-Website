Description of my styling choices:

I designed my website to reflect my personality and interests, using bright colors, cool fonts, and interactive elements. This is an overview of the styling choices I made to make the site feel cool and unique.

First, I wanted the website to feel fun and approachable, so I chose a bright color scheme with a gradient background that transitions from soft pink to peach. This background (using colors #ff9a9e to #fad0c4) creates a warm tone. I also customized the fonts to reflect a balance between professionalism and personality. I used Comic Sans MS for the body text, which gives it a relaxed, friendly vibe, while keeping Georgia for headings to add a slightly more classic look.

To make navigation easy, I added interactive hover effects to different elements. For example, the links in the navigation bar subtly scale up when hovered over, creating a responsive feel as users move between pages. I also included hover animations for images so when the cursor moves over an image, it rotates and scales slightly, adding a fun element. Also, the main heading (h1) changes colors continuously in a smooth animation loop, giving looks to the title of each page and giving the website a lively, animated touch.

I also wanted the contact form to be both functional and visually appealing, so I styled it with a clean white background, rounded corners, and a little shadow. This makes the form stand out without overpowering the rest of the content. When the "Send Message" button is hovered, it changes color to a deeper shade, giving users feedback that their action is being recognized.

To make my lists more exciting, I added a hover effect that changes the background color and scales up each list item when itâ€™s selected. This keeps the list sections visually engaging and helps people focus on each item. Also, I kept the footer simple and clean, using a dark background with light text to create contrast from the rest of the page, giving the website a cool look.

I think that these customizations help create a unique and interactive experience that reflects my style and personality. I wanted the website to feel fun, ufriendly, and engaging.
